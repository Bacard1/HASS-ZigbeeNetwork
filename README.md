The integration of a Zigbee network into Home Assistant allows managing devices such as sensors, switches and lamps through local, wireless communication.The Zigbee coordinator (eg Zigbee USB stick) is connected to Home Assistant via Zigbee2mqt or ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation).After installation and configuration of integration, the devices are added to the network (Pairing) and become available for automation and visualization in Home Assistant.

  - After launching the system, open the "Mosquitto Broker" configuration and go to Yaml Edit mode.Replace everything with this code üîΩ:

```yaml
logins:
    - username: "!secret mqtt_user"
    password: "!secret mqtt_pass"
require_certificate: false
certfile: cer.pem
keyfile: key.pem
customize:
active: false
folder: mosquitto
anonymous: false
server: mqtt://_________________:1883
base_topic: zigbee2mqtt
debug: true
```
> [!WARNING]
>On "Server" fill in the IP address of the device where Home Assistant is installed üîº.
  - Add the following lines to "Secrets.Yaml".If this is not done then the configuration cannot be valid üîΩ.

    ```yaml
    # MQTT login daten
    mqtt_user: _____________

    ```

> [!WARNING]
>Fill in your preferred username and password with them you will contact MQTT.Save the changes and start "Mosquitto Broker".Make sure "Mosquitto Broker" has started successfully and continue with the installation of "Zigbee2mqt"
- **Installing Zigbee2mqtt in Home Assistant:**
  - Press the button downstairs to add the Zigbee2mqtt storage to your additives üîΩ:
